# Control Flow and Structs

Some rust codes for solving the Codeforces Problem [Yet another A + B](http://codeforces.com/gym/100735/problem/I), using control flows and some typical built-in data structures (like [Vector](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-01-vectors.html), [String](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-02-strings.html), etc.).
